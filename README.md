# Ive's profesional portfolio page

Here are some fun and interesting projects I've been developing for learning or enjoyment.

## Introduction

Hi, I'm Ive! I'm a Brazilian software developer with broad experience in software development. The projects I've been involved in throughout my career vary from game development to research in machine learning. I'm passionate about learning new technologies and sharing my knowledge, whether through teaching or mentoring by example. Here, I want to share a small part of my knowledge through the technologies and stacks I've worked with over the last few years (at least the projects that I can share publicly). Feel welcome to explore and contact me to share your thoughts.

## The Portfolio Project

This project is part of the portfolio itself and has been developed with pure Vanilla JavaScript, WebAPI, HTML, and CSS.

### Bootstrapping

Since it's a simple HTML stack project, all you need to do to run it is open it in a web browser of your preference. That's it!
